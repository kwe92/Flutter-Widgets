//  PageRouteBuilder

//    - allows the user to customize route transition animations

//    - NOTE: Route is synonymous to: Page, Screen, or View

// Curve Class

//   - A collection of common animation curves that can alter how a Route enters into view
//    adjusting the rate of the animation over time

//   - i.e. does the Route (View / Screen) start fast and end slow (Curves.easeIn) or does it bounce into view (Curves.bounceIn)


// Offset.zero

//   - equivalent to OffSet(0,0) and represents the origin of 2-d Real Cartesian Coordinate Space (two dimensional grid system)

//   - the y-axis is inverted relative to the mathematical 2-D Cartesian Plane and increases in the downward direction
